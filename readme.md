# myhELO Coding Assessment

## Introduction

Hi! Welcome to the myhELO Coding Assessment. This is a short, open-ended project that asks you to come up with a neat visualization using data from the FDA API.

## Instructions

1. Download this project to your local PC. You can run everything locally; you do not need to set up a web or database server.
2. Open index.html in your favorite browser. You should see a page with a title and some JSON.
3. Open visualization.js, choose an API call, then update the decorate_data() function to display the data in a meaningful way.

That's it! You are welcome to spend 10 minutes dumping the data into an HTML table, but that's not going to get you very many points. We're not expecting a Mona Lisa, but we want to be surprised and impressed! Build something you would be proud to show off.

Here are a few directions you could take things:
- Use a graphing library and generate some really cool and robust visuals
- Make the application stand out by using some beautiful CSS styles
- Go full mobile and focus on responsiveness across devices
- Perform some advanced analysis using results from multiple API calls
- Add some level of interactivity; the FDA has a very powerful API

The code is yours to change however you like. Just remember, have fun and show off your strengths and interests!

## Wrapping up

When you're done, simply zip up your project and email it to jziebell@myhelo.com. You're welcome to host it online and send us a link, but that is not required.
