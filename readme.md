# myhELO Coding Assessment
Welcome! For this exercise, you'll be working with an existing codebase to demonstrate your skills and creativity. This year, we're emphasizing the use of AI tools to help you achieve the best possible output in the shortest amount of time. We encourage you to use AI coding assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or others to assist you throughout this task. The goal is not just to complete the task but to see how effectively you can leverage AI to improve your process, learn new things, and enhance your final output.

## What We’re Looking For
This project is intentionally open-ended, there’s no single “right” answer or required feature set. The goal is to see how you approach an unfamiliar codebase, make decisions, and apply your creativity (especially with AI tools).

You’re free to take the project in any direction that reflects your interests and strengths. We care most about your reasoning, the quality of your implementation, and how effectively you use AI to improve your process. Think of it as an opportunity to show us how you would shape this project if it were yours.

## Instructions:
**1. Download the Project:**
- Clone this GitHub project to your local machine.
- Open index.html in your browser to run the project.
- The project runs entirely locally, and the JavaScript you write will process in your browser. Any API calls you make will also be handled directly through JavaScript in the browser.

**2. Edit the Code:**
- Open visualization.js and examine the decorate_data() function.
- Choose an API call from the provided examples or come up with your own. Update the decorate_data() function based on the API you chose. This could involve modifying or adding code in other parts of the project.

**3. Leverage AI Tools:**
- We expect you to use AI to assist in building the best website you can. The AI can help you with:
  - Writing and refining code
  - Debugging and troubleshooting
  - Optimizing performance
  - Learning new concepts (e.g., creating visual graphs, adding interactivity, or exploring APIs)
- Feel free to use AI for creative solutions as well. The sky’s the limit!

**4. Be Creative:**

The code is yours to modify. We want to see your strengths and interests reflected in the final product. Here are a few directions you could take:
- Polish the UI: Use CSS to create a beautiful, modern design.
- Mobile-First: Ensure the site is fully responsive across devices.
- Advanced API Analysis: Perform deeper analysis using data from multiple API calls.
- Interactivity: Add interactive elements to make the application more dynamic.
- Custom Features: Write your own basic chart library or even turn the project into a game or text-based adventure.

**5. When You're Done:**

There’s no strict endpoint, stop when you feel your project meaningfully demonstrates your skills and approach. Most people spend around 3–5 hours.

We don’t expect a polished production app; we’re interested in your thought process, creativity, and use of AI. As long as your project:

- Runs locally and fetches/processes some data
- Shows clear evidence of thoughtful design or experimentation
- Includes your brief AI usage report

…you’ve met the spirit of the assignment.

## Running the Project Locally:
Once you have downloaded the project:
- Simply open index.html in your browser. This will run the entire project locally on your machine.
- Any JavaScript you add will execute in your browser, and all API calls you make will be processed through JavaScript.

## AI Usage Report:
At the end of the exercise, include a brief paragraph or two explaining:
- How you used AI tools (specific examples are appreciated).
- What worked well and what didn’t work as expected.
- What new concepts or techniques you learned using AI, and whether or not you were able to successfully implement them.

## Important Notes:
- Remember to follow the existing coding styles and conventions in the codebase.
- Have fun, and let your imagination guide you. We’re excited to see what you come up with!

## Wrapping up

When you're done, simply zip up your project and email it to careers@myhelo.com.
